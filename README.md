# Tyre Quality Prediction

## Overview

This project is focused on predicting tyre quality based on operational data from the tyre manufacturing process. The goal is to classify tyres as either **high-quality** or **defective** using machine learning techniques to enhance quality control and identify defects early in production.

---

## Project Objectives

The main objectives are:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing production data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting key features that impact tyre quality.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Building and assessing machine learning models to predict tyre quality and evaluate their performance using accuracy and precision.

---

## Data Description

The dataset includes:
- **Sensor Data**: Recorded during the tyre manufacturing process.
- **Quality Labels**: Indicating whether a tyre is high-quality or defective based on post-production inspection.

## Process Flow

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing inconsistencies and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new variables that may influence the quality of the tyres.
3. **Model Training**: Using machine learning algorithms to predict tyre quality.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the models' performance through metrics like accuracy.
5. **Prediction**: Applying the trained model to predict tyre quality on new data.
